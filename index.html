<br> Also called the <b>domestic dog</b>, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.<br> The dog was the first species to be <big>domesticated by humans</big> 
over <small>.14,000 years ago</small> 
and before the development of agriculture.<br><br>

Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br>
Dogs have been bred for <strong>desired behaviors</strong>, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<br> Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.<br> They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the
 tail),
 powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. 
<br>Compared to humans, dogs have an inferior visual acuity, a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large olfactory cortex. 
<br>They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, <em>.companionship</em>, therapy, aiding disabled people, and <u>assisting police and the military</u>.<br> 
there are more numbers than there are dogs!, 10<sub>10</sub>or 10<sup>10</sup><br>

if  nhumber is &gt; than a nnumber then it is greater than.<br>
if one number &amp; another number are same we say they are equal.<br>
how do we know if a number is an integer or not ?<br>
we can simply check!, by checking the integers if positive or negative &hyphen;<br>
it is once said by a famous mathamatician that &quot; numbers are the prime unit of life &quot;.</p><br>
